<h5>Domains of Expertise</h5>
<p>Complex Systems; Multi-agent Systems; Multi-agent modelling and social simulation; Agent based multi modal logistics/transport and supply chains;  Human behaviour modelling and agent based geospatial social simulations; Agent Based Social Simulation for Earthquake Crisis; Pedestrian evacuation simulation; Graph theory and comparison of semantic networks/graphs; Geospatial modelling, analysis and visualisation (2D/3D); Geographic Information Systems (GIS); Remote Sensing (RS) and Image Analysis; and Geomatics; Multidisciplinary Research.</p>

<h5>About Me</h5>
<p>I am a computer scientist engaged in multidisciplinary research developing multi-agent models and simulations of complex systems. In particular, I specialise in the modelling and simulation of:  (a) human behaviour in the context of pedestrian evacuations during seismic crisis; and  (b) multimodal transport and logistics. I also work on graph theoretic methods focused on the modelling, analysis and comparison of semantic networks/graphs applied to the governance structures of European ports.</p>
<p>Currently a postdoctoral researcher at LITIS (Laboratoire d'Informatique, du Traitement de l'Information et des Systèmes), INSA (Institut National des Sciences Appliquées, https://www.insa-rouen.fr/recherche/laboratoires/litis), Rouen Normandie, France. The postdoc is for the RIN PORTERR project, and its focus is on dynamic semantic graphs, graph comparison (governance structure of ports), and the multi-agent modelling and simulation of logistics flows/traffic in the Seine Axis and the ports of Normandy, France. This continues my post-doc with LITIS-R2IC (Réseaux d’interactions et Intelligence Collective https://www.litislab.fr/equipe/ri2c) at Université Le Havre, Normandy France.<p/>
<p>Completed my PhD in Computer Science in 2019 on Multi-agent modelling of seismic crisis at the University of Grenoble Alpes, France. The PhD research integrated computer, social, geoscience and geographic information sciences to model and simulate human behaviour during seismic crisis. During the PhD, I was connected with two laboratories: LIG (Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble https://www.liglab.fr/ , Team: MAGMA/HAWAI http://hawai.imag.fr/) and PACTE (Laboratoire des sciences sociales, Team: Environnemets: https://www.pacte-grenoble.fr/page/environnements).<p/>
<p>Before my PhD, my previous roles in the Philippines included University Research Associate, University Extension Associate, Laboratory Manager (Remote Sensing and GIS Laboratories), Remote Sensing (RS) specialist, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) expert, Python Programmer, and geo-web mapping applications developer. I was also a Lecturer/Instructor in some undergraduate (BSc Geodetic Engineering) and graduate (MSc Remote Sensing) classes, and training courses (Remote Sensing, GIS, Web GIS, Python Programming for Geospatial Applications).</p>
<p>I obtained my Masters degree in Remote Sensing in 2008, and my Bachelors degree in Geodetic Engineering in 2000, from the University of the Philippines.</p>
<p>I have experience that span 19 years in GIS and RS, consulting, research and academia (+PhD and PostDoc). Extensively utilized proprietary systems ( ESRI's ArcGIS) and open source software (QGIS and Grass). For agent based modeling and simulations, extensive use of the GAMA-platform. Also an active volunteer mapper with OpenStreetMap and an advocate of the use of Open Data/Software.</p>
<p>I am currently based in Le Havre and Rouen, Normandie, France.</p>
