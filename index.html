<h5>Domains of Expertise</h5>
<p>Multi agent systems. Multi agent modelling and simulation. Human behaviour modelling and agent based geospatial social simulation. Seismic risk/crisis modelling and Pedestrian evacuation. Multimodal transport and logistics. Geospatial analysis, visualisation and simulation. Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Societies. Complex Systems. Networks. Dynamic Semantic Graphs. Geographic Information Systems. Remote Sensing. Geomatics.</p>

<h5>About Me</h5>
<p>I am a computer scientist engaged in multidisciplinary research developing multi-agent models and simulations of complex systems. In particular, I specialise in the modelling and simulation of:  (a) human behaviour in the context of pedestrian evacuations during seismic crisis; and  (b) multimodal transport and logistics. I also work on graph theoretic methods focused on the modelling, analysis and comparison of semantic networks/graphs applied to the governance structures of European ports.</p>
<p>I obtained my PhD in Computer Science in 2019 from Université Grenoble Alpes, France. During the PhD, I was connected with the LIG (Team: HAwAI /Magma) and PACTE (Team: Environnements) laboratories. I started my post doc in 2020 at LITIS (Team: RI2C), Université Le Havre Normandie, France. In 2021, I continued my post doc at LITIS, INSA-Rouen (Team: RI2C​), Normandie, France.</p>
<p>I obtained my Masters degree in Remote Sensing in 2008, and my Bachelors degree in Geodetic Engineering in 2000, from the University of the Philippines.</p>
<p>I am currently based in Le Havre and Rouen, Normandie, France.</p>
