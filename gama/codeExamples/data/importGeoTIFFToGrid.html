/**
* Name: GeoTIFF file to Grid of Cells 
* Author:  Patrick Taillandier
* Description: Model which shows how to create a grid of cells by using a GeoTIFF File. 
*   It is important to notice that GAMA can only read GeoTIFF files with Bytes data type (files that are often displayed in grayscale)
*   The GeoTIFF files with Float32 or Float64 data type cannot be read for the moments.
*   Their metadata can neither been read in the Model library explorer.
* Tags:  load_file, tif, gis, grid
