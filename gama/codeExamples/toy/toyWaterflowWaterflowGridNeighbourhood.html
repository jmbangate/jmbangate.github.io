/***
* Name: Water flow in a river represented by a set of cells
* Author: Benoit Gaudou and Patrick Taillandier
* Description: In this model, the space is discretised using a grid. Thus the river is a set of cells. 
* 	The data comes from a raster image.
* 	The upstream cells (i.e. the source cells) are chosen by the modeler.
* 	Initialy, an order is computed by neighborhood to make the water flows from the source cells, all over the river.
* 	At each step, the cells transmits a part of their water to their downstream cells (the neighbor cells with a greater order number).
* Tags: grid, gui, hydrology, water flow
