Agents with mild preferences for same-type neighbors, but without preferences for segregated neighborhoods, can wind up producing complete segregation.\\n\\u25B6 In this model, agents populate a grid with a given *density*. They are in two different states : happy when the percentage of same-color neighbours is above their *desired percentage of similarity*; unhappy otherwise. In the latter case, they change their location randomly until they find a neighbourhood that fits their desire. \\n\\u25B6 In addition to the previous parameter, one can adjust the *distance of perception* (i.e.  the distance at which they consider other agents as neighbours) of the agents to see how it affects the global process.
