/***
* Name: CityEscape
* Author: kevinchapuis
* Description: An evacuation model of a theoretical city with different alert communication strategies. Hazard is a very simple flood
* and we make the hypothesis that people die when they are in the flood (e.g. Tsunami). The flooding start x time after the beginning
* of the simulation. People escape when they perceive the flood or when they are alerted. There are 3 communication strategies: 
* - 'EVERYONE' = to alert everyone at the start of the simulation
* - 'STAGED' = to alert nb_people/nb_stages random people every (time_of_hazard-buffer_time)/nb_stages minutes
* - 'SPATIAL' = to alert nb_people/nb_stages closest people to exits every (time_of_hazard-buffer_time)/nb_stages minutes
* Where (time_of_hazard-buffer_time)/nb_stages correspond to the time between stages computed using the three parameters:
* - Time before hazard = time_of_hazard
* - Time alert buffer before hazard = buffer_time
* - Number of stages = nb_stages
* Tags: evacuation, traffic, hazard, gis, water
