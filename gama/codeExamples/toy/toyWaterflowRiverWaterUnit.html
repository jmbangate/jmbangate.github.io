/***
* Name: Water flow in a river graph, using water units
* Author: Benoit Gaudou
* Description: In this model, the flow of water is simulated through the move of water units from a source point toward the outlet point.
* 	Every step a source point is chosen to create a water unit, that will then flow toward the outlet point.
* Tags: shapefile, gis, graph, gui, hydrology, water flow
