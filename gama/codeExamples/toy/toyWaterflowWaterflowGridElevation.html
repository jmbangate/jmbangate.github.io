/***
* Name: Water flow in a river represented by a set of cells, depending on the elevation
* Author: Benoit Gaudou
* Description: In this model, the space is discretised using a grid. Thus the river is a set of cells, each of them with an elevation.
* 	The data comes from a DEM (Digital Elevation Model) file.
* 	The upstream cells (i.e. the source cells) and the downstrem cells (i.e. the drain cells) are chosen by the modeler.
* 	At each step, the cells transmits a part of their water to their neighbor cells that are lower (their height is computed taken into account their elevation and height of water.
