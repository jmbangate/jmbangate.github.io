/***
* Name: Water flow in a river graph, using water flow in rivers
* Author: Benoit Gaudou and Patrick Taillandier
* Description: In this model, the flow of water is modeled through the exchange of water between elements of rivers.
* 	The only water input comes (every 20 steps) from the source points. Then the water flows toward the outlet point.
