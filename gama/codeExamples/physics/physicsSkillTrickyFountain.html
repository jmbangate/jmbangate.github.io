/**
* Name: Tricky fountain
* Author: Arnaud Grignard - Alexis Drogoul 2021
* Description: This is a model that shows how the physics engine works using a tank, with a floor and 4 walls, and balls of water
* falling into it. The model is exploiting the viewpoint of the user (thanks to the camera_location and camera_target) to give the illusion
* of a fake gravity (in a completely unrealistic way, just for the demo !).
