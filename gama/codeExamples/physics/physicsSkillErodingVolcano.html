/**
* Name: Eroding Vulcano
* Author: Alexis Drogoul - 2021
* Description: This is a model that shows how the physics engine works, especially with the definition of uneven terrains, the dynamic
* change of shapes of agents and the callback actions when contacts occur between agents. 
* A vulcano, situated at the highest point of a DEM, erupts and the lava, falling down on the ground, erodes every patch of terrain it touches. The 
* slope of the terrain evolves as more and more lava is produced (the epicenter of the eruption even changing when higher patches appear).
