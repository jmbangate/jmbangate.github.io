/**
* Name:  Shortest Path Computation on a Graph
* Author:  Patrick Taillandier
* Description: Model to show how to use the optimizer methods to compute the shortest path for the agents placed on a network with all of them 
*	having the same goal location. It also shows how to save these paths computed into a text file.
* Tags: graph, agent_movement, skill, shortest_path, algorithm

	/*11 shortest path algorithms can be used for the shortest path computation:
	 *    - Dijkstra: ensure to find the best shortest path - compute one shortest path at a time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm
	 * 	  - BidirectionalDijkstra: default one - ensure to find the best shortest path - compute one shortest path at a time: https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahmto/math/2020/05/30/bidirectional-dijkstra.html
	 *    - BellmannFord: ensure to find the best shortest path - compute one shortest path at a time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman-Ford_algorithm
	 * 	  - AStar: ensure to find the best shortest path if for any edge, the weight of the edge is greater than or equal to the distance between the source and the target of the edge. - compute one shortest path at a time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm
	 *    - NBAStar: ensure to find the best shortest path if for any edge, the weight of the edge is greater than or equal to the distance between the source and the target of the edge.- compute one shortest path at a time: http://repub.eur.nl/pub/16100/ei2009-10.pdf
	 *    - NBAStarApprox: does not ensure to find the best shortest path - compute one shortest path at a time: http://repub.eur.nl/pub/16100/ei2009-10.pdf
	 *    - FloydWarshall: ensure to find the best shortest path - compute all the shortest paths at the same time (and keep them in memory): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd-Warshall_algorithm
	 * 	  - BellmannFord: ensure to find the best shortest path - compute one shortest path at a time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman-Ford_algorithm
	 *    - DeltaStepping: ensure to find the best shortest path - compute one shortest path at a time: The delta-stepping algorithm is described in the paper: U. Meyer, P. Sanders, $\Delta$-stepping:  a parallelizable shortest path algorithm, Journal of Algorithms, Volume 49, Issue 1, 2003, Pages 114-152, ISSN 0196-6774
	 *    - CHBidirectionalDijkstra: ensure to find the best shortest path - compute one shortest path at a time. Based on precomputations (first call of the algorithm). Implementation of the hierarchical query algorithm based on the bidirectional Dijkstra search. The query algorithm is originally described the article: Robert Geisberger, Peter Sanders, Dominik Schultes, and Daniel Delling. 2008. Contraction hierarchies: faster and simpler hierarchical routing in road networks. In Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Experimental algorithms (WEA'08), Catherine C. McGeoch (Ed.). Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, 319-333
	 *    - TransitNodeRouting: ensure to find the best shortest path - compute one shortest path at a time. Based on precomputations (first call of the algorithm). The algorithm is designed to operate on sparse graphs with low average outdegree. the algorithm is originally described the article: Arz, Julian &amp; Luxen, Dennis &amp; Sanders, Peter. (2013). Transit Node Routing Reconsidered. 7933. 10.1007/978-3-642-38527-8_7.
