/**
* Name: Anisotropic diffusion (Simple)
* Author: Benoit Gaudou
* Description: This model is used to show how to construct an anisotropic diffusion through a grid. The cell at the center of the grid emit a pheromon at each step, which is spread 
*     through the grid thanks to the diffusion mechanism, using a particular matrix of diffusion.
* Tags: diffusion, matrix, math, elevation
