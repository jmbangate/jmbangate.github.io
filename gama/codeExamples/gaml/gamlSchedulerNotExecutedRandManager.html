* Description: This model shows how a species can manage other species execution process. In the facet schedules of the 
			manager species, the list of the agents of the species B and A has been given. B agents will be executed first and then A agents.
			An important point is that the manager is not executed, since it is not scheduled anywhere, but it is still scheduling other species agents.
			This is shown with the reflex write_new_step belonging to the manager species that is not executed, not writing its text to the console.
