    <td>Presentation: "Multi agent modelling of seismic crisis", This presents the model: SOLACE (SOciaL Attachment and Crisis Evacuations) <br>Date: Nov 26, 2021</td>

    <td>This presents SOLACE, the multi agent model developed during my PhD, in great detail. SOLACE is a geospatial, microscopic model and social simulation of human behaviour and pedestrian evacuation during seismic/earthquake crisis. The research considered social attachment is the main driver of differerent behaviours and social interactions during evacuation. Threat or crisis situations trigger proximity seeking behaviours, making individuals seek attachment figures/objects/places etc. that give comfort or solace during threat. <br><br>
      
      The model also implements different earthquake intensity scenarios that cause damage to structures/building in the model. Debris are produced by damaged buildings in the simulation depending on the typology of the structure, its height, and the intensity of the earthquake. These debris result to: (a) blocked pathways trapping human agents and hindering evacuations; and/or (b) injuries or death to human agents who may be struck or entombed by debris.<br><br>  
      
      This was a plenary presentation at the 3 day PhilGEOS2021 Virtual Conference last November 18, 2021. The presentation starts at 1:30:33</td>

    <td>Agent evacuation as implemented in SOLACE. This short demo video shows how microscopic multi-agent/pedestrian earthquake evacuation is implemented in SOLACE. Dynamic social interactions as well as interactions with the physical elements in the seismic crisis environment (debris/barriers/safe zones) are shown in the simulation. Pre-evacuation behaviours, and the location of agents in the building (floor level), affect the times of egress from structures, and eventually the arrivals in safe areas. Social attachment influences evacuation, and can result to following behaviours. The increasing level of building damage during the earthquake duration is shown as a gradient of colors from light grey, orange, dark red, to maroon. Debris blocks are created/deposited randomly around damaged buildings during the duration of the earthquake. Human agents can be injured or killed when hit by debris. Doors and pathways/roads/alleys can likewise be blocked hindering evacuation or trapping agents. Human agents react to the presence of debris, injured agents and casualties. SOLACE is developed from the GAMA multi-agent platform.
