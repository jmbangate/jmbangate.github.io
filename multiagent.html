<h2>Multiagent Simulations</h2>

<p>A cataloge of some of my multiagent models and simulations developed in GAMA. The simulations are from October 2014 to the 2019. These can be similarly found in my simulation YouTube Channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1-lMBRbHIYzLdu7YUy-laQ/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1-lMBRbHIYzLdu7YUy-laQ/videos</a>.</p>

Green lines define the focus of parent agents (Triangles) towards evacuation areas (Grey polygon), Red lines between parent agents and child (Circle) agents,  Blue lines between parent agents. Child agent can only go with parent agents in the same social group (defined by colors: Blue, Green, Red and Yellow). In this simulation, parents from different social groups can interact.</td>

When close enough, Circle agents (located in doorways) with the same ID (color) follow. A white line can be seen connecting the agents.

    <td>Agent evacuation as implemented in SOLACE. This short demo video shows how microscopic multi-agent/pedestrian earthquake evacuation is implemented in SOLACE. Dynamic social interactions as well as interactions with the physical elements in the seismic crisis environment (debris/barriers/safe zones) are shown in the simulation. Pre-evacuation behaviours, and the location of agents in the building (floor level), affect the times of egress from structures, and eventually the arrivals in safe areas. Social attachment influences evacuation, and can result to following behaviours. The increasing level of building damage during the earthquake duration is shown as a gradient of colors from light grey, orange, dark red, to maroon. Debris blocks are created/deposited randomly around damaged buildings during the duration of the earthquake. Human agents can be injured or killed when hit by debris. Doors and pathways/roads/alleys can likewise be blocked hindering evacuation or trapping agents. Human agents react to the presence of debris, injured agents and casualties. SOLACE is developed from the GAMA multi-agent platform. Link to Phd Thesis: https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-..., Link to slides: https://mamscgfr.weebly.com/slides---...</td>

    <td>Agent dynamic social interactions, and interactions with the crisis environment, during evacuation. This short demo video shows how microscopic multi-agent/pedestrian earthquake evacuation is implemented in SOLACE. Dynamic social interactions as well as interactions with the physical elements in the seismic crisis environment (debris/barriers/safe zones) are shown in the simulation. This zoomed-in view shows how agents navigate in free space, how they perceive others (from social groups) and their environment (via perception angle/line/distance), and their resulting social interactions. The spatial constraints imposed by barriers (debris, buildings) to agent evacuation can likewise be seen. The emergent clustering of agents in safe areas is also shown.
